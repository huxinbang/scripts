If you use Windows, you may need install [msysgit](http://msysgit.github.com//).\r\n\r\n**Ctags**\r\n\r\n * Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of language objects found in source files that allows these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility. I recommend you to use [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\n*To use this distribution with less bugs, please get more suggestions from [here](https://github.com/kepbod/ivim/wiki/Tips-for-ivim)*\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n***Beautiful***\r\n\r\n * Use lots of famous colorschemes to make your eyes feel comfortable in both Vim and MacVim/gVim.\r\n\r\n    * [Hybrid](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid)(default)\r\n    * [Tomorrow-Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme)\r\n    * [Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized)\r\n    * [Jellybeans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim)\r\n\r\n ![screenshot](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-e-CWpdeh7GA/UJuyYagHmDI/AAAAAAAAAHU/k4hYnUHv2xg/s910/Tooltip_005.png)\r\n\r\n***Efficient***\r\n\r\n * Make using Vim more convenient and faster, and lots of useful plugins (such as [Neocomplcache](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache), [NERD_commenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter), [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) and [SingleCompile](https://github.com/xuhdev/SingleCompile)) confirm a better performance of Vim.\r\n\r\n*This distribution is completely customisable using a `~/.vimrc.local`, `~/.gvimrc.local` and `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`!*\r\n\r\n## Plugin List\r\n\r\n * [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) -

If you want one, just click it!\r\n\r\n*Key Mappings*\r\n\r\n* Because I have set some key mappings for more convenient typing and checking, you may feel inconvenient with them at start. But if you get familiar with them, I'm sure you will love them.\r\n\r\n    You can just type `:map` in Vim to see them.\r\n\r\n*More Tips*\r\n\r\n* [Vim_Tips_Wiki](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki) is an excellent website, and you can learn much from it.\r\n* [Vimcasts](http://vimcasts.org) publishes free screencasts about Vim. It's useful and interesting! Believe me!\r\n\r\n**Hope You Enjoy Vimming**\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\n**This distribution refers to many other famous Vim configurations (mainly contain [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim), [Champions' Configuration](https://github.com/mutewinter/dot_vim) and [Steve's Configuration](https://github.com/sjl/dotfiles/tree/master/vim)), so there may be some unavoidable errors in it, but I'll try my best to make it work well. If you have any questions, please feel free to [post your issues and suggestions](https://github.com/kepbod/ivim/issues)!
